# Permissioned candidate onboarding

A blockchain validator is a network node that helps process and validate transaction blocks on the platform according to the protocol consensus mechanism. A permissioned candidate is a block-producing validator that has been whitelisted by the chain builder so it can validate partner chain blocks and secure the network.

Before you begin, some software must be installed.

## Order of Operations

1. Install dependencies
    1. Cardano node v9.1.1
        1. DB Sync v13.5.0.2 (PostgreSQL v15.3)
2. Download the partner chain node v1.1.0
3. Run the generate-keys wizard
4. Share keys with the chain builder
5. Obtain the chain configuration and specification files
6. Run the partner chain node

**NOTE**

This guide is currently aimed at the **preview testnet only**. In most `cardano-node` operations, this can be set with `--testnet-magic 2`. If you need to set up an SPO, be sure it's set up on **preview**.

### 1. Install partner chains dependencies

To run the partner chains stack, several dependencies need to be installed on the Cardano node.

### 1.1 Cardano node v9.1.1

A passive Cardano node is required to validate a partner chain. The installation of `cardano-node` is out of the scope of this guide. Refer to the [Cardano course handbook](https://cardano-course.gitbook.io/cardano-course/handbook) for documentation and video instruction.

Once your node is synced with the preview testnet, you are ready to continue with this guide.

### 1.1.1 DB Sync

The partner chain needs DB Sync on a `cardano-node` to observe Cardano's state.

#### A critical note on Cardano DB Sync!

> Before starting the partner chain node, and during normal operations, it is essential that the DB Sync component is fully synchronized.
> Running the node with lagging or not fully synced DB Sync will result in consensus errors, decreased peer reputation, and possibly a temporary ban by network peers. 
> Sync time depends on hardware and network conditions, but here are approximate estimations for each network:

#### Sync time required

- Preview: About 10 hours
- Pre-production: usually ranges from several hours to a day
- Mainnet: two or more days.
  
Typical error message if db-sync is behind:
```
ðŸ’” Verification failed for block 0x151ed479f5766f8dc56fa3626329baa77292d5a692cf7fb9d24e743ae57fe71c received from (12D3KooWEyoppNCUx8Yx66oV9fJnriXwCcXwDDUA2kj6vnc6iDEp): "Main chain state e04eea9347162cd773a3505692d0aaee3d49b2c61f21a5b8a95f3d5711a63961 referenced in imported block at slot 286497345 with timestamp 1718984070000 not found"
```

1. Download the [binary](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-db-sync/releases) and add it to the PATH
2. Set up PostgreSQL server:
```
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
sudo systemctl start postgresql.service
```

Enter shell as default postgres user:
`sudo -i -u postgres`

Enter the postgres CLI: `psql`

Create user: `CREATE USER ubuntu WITH PASSWORD 'XXXXXXXXXXXXX';`

Change role permissions:
`ALTER ROLE ubuntu WITH SUPERUSER;`
`ALTER ROLE ubuntu WITH CREATEDB;`

Verify user is created and has role permissions: `\du`

Create database: `CREATE DATABASE cexplorer;`

Verify the database is created: `\l` 

Sample correct return:
```
List of databases
   Name    |  Owner   | Encoding | Collate |  Ctype  |   Access privileges   
-----------+----------+----------+---------+---------+-----------------------
 cexplorer | postgres | UTF8     | C.UTF-8 | C.UTF-8 | 
 postgres  | postgres | UTF8     | C.UTF-8 | C.UTF-8 | 
 template0 | postgres | UTF8     | C.UTF-8 | C.UTF-8 | =c/postgres          +
           |          |          |         |         | postgres=CTc/postgres
 template1 | postgres | UTF8     | C.UTF-8 | C.UTF-8 | =c/postgres          +
           |          |          |         |         | postgres=CTc/postgres
(4 rows)
```

If any command fails, restart postgres service:
`sudo systemctl restart postgresql.service`

This check should return empty. It will be filled with db sync relations:
`PGPASSFILE=~/cardano-db-sync/config/pgpass-preview ./postgresql-setup.sh --check`

3. Run DB Sync as a service
```
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/cardano-db-sync.service > /dev/null <<EOF
[Unit]
Description=Cardano DB Sync Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Environment=PGPASSFILE=/home/ubuntu/cardano-db-sync/config/pgpass-preview
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/cardano-db-sync --config /home/ubuntu/preview/configs/db-sync-config.json --socket-path /home/ubuntu/preview/node.socket --state-dir /home/ubuntu/preview/db-sync/ledger-state --schema-dir /home/ubuntu/cardano-db-sync/schema/
User=ubuntu
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```

Enable and start service:
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && \
sudo systemctl enable cardano-db-sync.service && \
sudo systemctl start cardano-db-sync.service
```

4. Observe logs
```
journalctl -fu cardano-dy-sync.service
```

---
**IMPORTANT NOTE**

Ensure that the node is synced with the network to 100% as well as Kupo and DB Sync before continuing beyond this point. On preview network, it is roughly 24 hours before sync is complete.

### 1.2 Download the Partner Chain node

1. Download the Partner Chain node from the [official repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/partner-chains)

### 2. Run the generate-keys wizard

The generate-keys wizard is designed to simplify the process of getting started with a partner chains node. This is the initial step for network participants who do not yet have keys.

The generate-keys wizard will generate necessary keys and save them to your nodeâ€™s keystore. The following keys will be created:

1. ECDSA cross-chain key
2. ED25519 Grandpa key
3. SR25519 Aura key

If these keys already exist in the nodeâ€™s keystore, you will be asked to overwrite existing keys. The wizard will also generate a network key for your node if needed.

1. Start the wizard: `./partner-chains-cli generate-keys`
2. Input the node base path. It is saved in `partner-chains-cli-resources-config.json`.

Now the wizard will output `partner-chains-public-keys.json` containing three keys.
``` javascript
{
	"sidechain_pub_key": "0x<key>",
	"aura_pub_key": "0x<key>",
	"grandpa_pub_key": "0x<key>"
}
```

### 4. Share keys with the chain builder

In this step, the `partner-chains-cli-public-keys.json` file needs to be shared with the chain builder so that the permissioned validator can be whitelisted.

Contact the chain builder and provide the `partner-chains-cli-public-keys.json` file.

### 5. Obtain the chain configuration and specification files

Obtaining these files is as simple as getting the file from the chain builder.

Contact the chain builder and request the `chain-spec.json` and `partner-chains-cli-chain-config.json` files.

### 6. Run the partner chain node

The start-node wizard is used to start a partner chain node. Make sure that `cardano-node` is running with DB Sync running and fully synced. You will need to provide a link to postgreSQL server running with DB Sync as part of starting the node.

1. Start the wizard: `./partner-chains-cli start-node`
2. The wizard checks if all required keys are present. If not, it reminds you to run the generate-keys wizard first, and exits.
3. If the `chain-spec` file is not present, you should obtain it from the chain builder.
4. The wizard checks the `partner-chains-cli-chain-config.json` file. If it is missing or invalid, you should obtain it from the chain builder.
5. If the `db_sync_postgres_connection_string` is missing from the `partner-chain-cli-resources-config.json` file, the wizard prompts for it, using the default value `postgresql://postgres-user:postgres-password@localhost:5432/cexplorer`.
6. The wizard outputs all relevant parameters and asks if they are correct. If not, you should edit the `partner-chains-cli-chain-config.json` and/or `partner-chain-cli-resources-config.json` files and run the wizard again.

The wizard sets the required environment variables and starts the node.

---
**NOTE**

The configuration of the chain is stored in the file `partner-chains-cli-chain-config.json`. This file needs to remain idential with other nodes in the network.

---

---
**NOTE**

Information about the resources used by each node is stored in the file `partner-chain-cli-resources-config.json`. This file should be present on every node in the network, but its contents are specific to each node.
