## Changed

* polkadot-sdk dependency updated to partnerchains-stable2407 (stable2407 is v1.15.0 in the previous scheme)
* changed the inner type of `McBlockHash` from Vec to an array
* ETCM-7985 - bumped `partner-chains-smart-contracts` version and updated the `partner-chains-cli`
to match. Now `partner-chains-cli` passes a network parameter to `sidechain-main-cli` where necessary.
* governance authority key hash is now calculated in `prepare-configuration` without using external `cardano-cli`

## Removed

* removed Relay docker build files
* removed usage of 'storage::getter' macros, following polkadot-sdk changes
