## Changed
* ETCM-7422 - decoupled all pallet crates from their related inherent data crates. Moved all primitives
(types, error types, runtime APIs etc.) to separate crates in `primitives/` directory. Now for each
`pallet-*` crate there is a corresponding `sp-*` crate.
* ETCM-7423 - moved `McHashInherentDataProvider`, `IncomingTransactionsProvider`, `AriadneInherentDataProvider` and `CrossChainSignaturesInherentDataProvider`
creation logic out of the node crate, to their respective primitive crates.
Cleaned `inherent_data.rs` which now contains only wiring and necessary minor helper logic.
* ETCM-6709 - db-sync implementation of CandidatesDataSource has built-in caching, that is used only for stable main chain data. main-chain-follower-caching create is removed.
* Inherent data provider creation logic now uses error types instead of boxed errors where it's possible
* renamed the `block-rewards-primitives` crate to `sp-block-rewards` for consistency
* made `pallet-block-rewards` crate depend on `sp-block-rewards` and moved some types and traits there

## Fixed
* ETCM-7463 - fixed incoming transactions cache in db-sync-follower, it was not working at all
