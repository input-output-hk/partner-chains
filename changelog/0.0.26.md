## Added

* Added an optional `slot` parameter to `getEpochPhase` json RPC method
* BREAKING: ETCM-6767 - store and verify mainchain block hash in header
* ETCM-6766 - main chain follower implementation for getting blocks for main chain state reference
* ETCM-6765 - add BLOCK_STABILITY_MARGIN to the configuration
* ETCM-6855 - incoming transactions with invalid recipient are filtered out when reading inherents, RPC method `sidechain_getIncomingTransactions` doesn't fail when there are transactions with invalid recipients.
* ETCM-6777 - verify that mainchain state reference slot is high enough to calculate next committee
* ETCM-6954 - update to partnerchains-polkadot-v1.9.0 (public fork), update most of the dependencies

## Changed
* BREAKING: ETCM-5898 - remove storage maps from pallet-session-validator-management and simplify the committee rotation logic
* ETCM-6877 - improved the performance of getting the latest on chain committee hash, requires update in deployment configuration.
* ETCM-6822 - update partner-chains-smart-contracts revision to: 76f57380b6d85f2c1a1f212591a99ebd0db96213.
* ETCM-6816, ETCM-6813 - removed dependency on `sidechain-inherents`, `mock-types` and `sidechain-domain` from `pallet-session-validator-management` crate
* ETCM-6813 - moved authority selection code from `sidechain-inherents` to a new `authority-selection-inherents` crate
* ETCM-6813 - moved code shared between `authority-selection-inherents` and `pallet-session-validator-management`
to a new crate `sp-session-validator-management`
* BREAKING: ETCM-6777 - all ariadne main chain data used for selecting the committees for partner chain epochs which take place during main chain epoch N is now sourced from last slot of main chain epoch N-2
* changed logic in `authority-selection-inherents` crate to operate on Sr25519 and Ed25519 public key
types instead of raw byte arrays
* BREAKING: ETCM-6776 - use MC hash in the incoming transactions calculation
* ETCM-7072 - move `ValidatorManagementSessionManager` to a dedicated crate

## Fixed
* ETCM-6854 - make endpoints_spec.json file consistent with the actual implementation in session-validator-management
* ETCM-7051 - sidechain_getEpochSignatures nextCommitteePubKeys were returning next committee of the current epoch
* ETCM-7081 - fixed 'check_inherent' when committee cannot be selected from inherent data
* ETCM-7115 - fixed `sidechain_getEpochCommittee` RPC method returning wrong committee for next epoch from now
* ETCM-7143 - fixed invalid block queries for the stable block at in dbsync-mainchain-follower
