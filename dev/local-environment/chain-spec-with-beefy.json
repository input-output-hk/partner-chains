Unable to start the node due to missing or malformed environment variables. This issue typically occurs when the node executable is launched directly. Instead, please use the `./partner-chains-cli start-node` command, which sets up all the necessary environment variables for you. This command also displays the complete node startup command, including the required environment variables, allowing you to use it directly if needed.
