# Native Token Management Primitives

## About

This crate implements the primitives and inherent data provider for observability of native token
transfers to illiquid supply on main chain. See rustdoc comments in this crate and the coresponding
pallet for more information.


## Migration

See the guide in `docs/developer-guides/native-token-migration-guide.md` for how to add this
feature to an already running chain.
