//! A Substrate pallet maintaining a consumable log of block production information.
//!
//! ## Purpose of this pallet
//!
//! This pallet keeps a log containing block producer IDs along with slot numbers of blocks produced by them.
//! This log is updated every block and is meant to consumed by other features.
//! The intended use of this pallet within the Partner Chains SDK is to expose block production data for consumption
//! by the Block Participation feature implemented by the `sp_block_participation` and `pallet_block_participation`
//! crates.
//!
//! ## Usage - PC Builder
//!
//! This pallet requires inherent data provided by the inherent data provider defined by `sp_block_producerion_log`
//! crate. Consult the crate's documentation for instruction on how to wire it into the node correctly.
//!
//! ### Adding to the runtime
//!
//! The pallet requires a minimal configuration. Consult the documentation for [pallet::Config] for details.
//!
//! An example configuration for a runtime using Aura consensus might look like this:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! impl pallet_block_production_log::Config for Runtime {
//!     type BlockProducerId = BlockAuthor;
//!     type WeightInfo = pallet_block_production_log::weights::SubstrateWeight<Runtime>;
//!
//!     fn current_slot() -> sp_consensus_slots::Slot {
//!         let slot: u64 = pallet_aura::CurrentSlot::<Runtime>::get().into();
//!         sp_consensus_slots::Slot::from(slot)
//!     }
//!
//!     #[cfg(feature = "runtime-benchmarks")]
//!     type BenchmarkHelper = PalletBlockProductionLogBenchmarkHelper;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! #### Defining block producer ID
//!
//! The pallet expects the Partner Chain to provide a type representing its block producers.
//! This type can be as simple as an Aura public key but can also be a more complex type if block producers
//! are not a homogenous group. For example, in the context of a Partner Chain using Ariadne committee selection,
//! it's typical to have two kinds of block producers: permissioned producers provided by the governance authority
//! and registered candidates recruited from among Cardano stake pool operators. In this instance an example
//! author type could be:
//! ```rust
//! use sidechain_domain::*;
//!
//! pub enum BlockAuthor {
//!     Incentivized(CrossChainPublicKey, StakePoolPublicKey),
//!     ProBono(CrossChainPublicKey),
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Keep in mind that other Partner Chains SDK components put their own constraints on the block author type
//! that need to be adhered to for a Partner Chain to integrated them.
//!
//! #### Support for adding to a running chain
//!
//! The pallet and its inherent data provider defined in [sp_block_production_log] are written in a way that allows for
//! adding it to an already live chain. The pallet allows for an initial period where inherent data is unavailable
//! and considers its inherent extrinsic required only after the first block where inherent data is provided.
//! Conversely, the inherent data provider is active only when the pallet and its runtime API is present for it to call.
//!
//! ### Consuming the log
//!
//! **Important**: Consuming the log is a destructive operation. Multiple features should not consume the log data
//!                unless they are coordinated to read and clear the same log prefix.
//!
//! The pallet exposes three functions that allow other pallets to consume its data: `take_prefix`, `peek_prefix`
//! and `drop_prefix`. Any feature using the log should be able to identify the slot number up to which it should
//! process the log data and either:
//! - call `take_prefix` from some pallet's logic and process the returned data within the same block
//! - call `peek_prefix` inside an inherent data provider and use `drop_prefix` from the corresponding pallet
//!   to clear the previously peeked data within the same block
//!
//! It is critically important to drop exactly the prefix processed to avoid either skipping or double-counting some blocks.
//!
//! ## Usage - PC user
//!
//! This pallet does not expose any user-facing functionalities.
//!
