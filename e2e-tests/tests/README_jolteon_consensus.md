## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
- Jolteon environment running (`jolteon_docker` or similar)
- Access to Substrate node RPC endpoints
- Python test environment with required dependencies

### Basic Test Execution
```bash
# Run all Jolteon consensus tests
pytest tests/ -m jolteon

# Run only basic consensus tests
pytest tests/test_jolteon_consensus.py

# Run only advanced consensus tests
pytest tests/test_jolteon_advanced.py

# Run RPC-based consensus tests
pytest tests/test_jolteon_consensus_rpc.py

# Run 2-chain commit rule tests
pytest tests/test_jolteon_two_chain_commit.py

# Run specific test by key
pytest tests/ -k "JOLTEON-001"
```

### Environment-Specific Execution
```bash
# For jolteon_docker environment
pytest tests/ -m jolteon --env jolteon_docker

# With specific blockchain type
pytest tests/ -m jolteon --blockchain substrate
```


## Understanding the Tests

### What These Tests Verify
1. **Happy Path**: Normal operation under good network conditions
2. **Safety**: No forks, proper block ordering, no duplicates
3. **Liveness**: Continuous progress and round advancement
4. **Protocol Compliance**: Jolteon-specific rules (2-chain commit)

### What These Tests Don't Cover Yet
1. **Fault Tolerance**: Leader failures, network partitions
2. **Performance**: Throughput under various conditions
3. **Edge Cases**: Extreme network conditions, DDoS scenarios
4. **Threshold Signatures**: Cryptographic verification of QCs/TCs

## Customization and Extension

### Adding New Test Cases
1. Follow the existing test structure and naming conventions
2. Include comprehensive logging for debugging
3. Add proper error handling and graceful degradation

### Modifying Test Parameters
- Adjust wait times based on your network characteristics
- Modify block sampling intervals for different consensus speeds
- Customize assertion thresholds based on expected performance

### Environment-Specific Adaptations
- Modify RPC endpoint handling for different Jolteon implementations
- Adjust consensus metadata extraction for different block formats
- Customize authority verification for different governance models

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Round Number Extraction**: May need adjustment based on actual block structure
2. **Certification Detection**: Heuristic-based approach may need refinement
3. **Timing Sensitivity**: Adjust wait times based on network performance
4. **RPC Compatibility**: Ensure Substrate interface version compatibility

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Run with verbose logging
pytest tests/ -m jolteon -v -s --log-cli-level=DEBUG

# Run single test with detailed output
pytest tests/test_jolteon_consensus.py::TestJolteonConsensus::test_qc_formation_and_round_advancement -v -s
```

## Contributing

When adding new test cases:

1. Implement tests incrementally (simple â†’ complex)
2. Include proper documentation and logging
3. Test thoroughly in your Jolteon environment
4. Update this README with new test information
