# Partner Chains Tests

Welcome to `Partner Chains Tests`, a powerful and flexible test automation framework for system and end-to-end (E2E) tests for partner chains.

## Pytest e2e-test Overview

### Features

- **Blockchain agnostic**
  - Execute any test against multiple blockchains! Thanks to the abstraction of `BlockchainApi`, you can write tests for different blockchains. For example, we've implemented `SubstrateApi` for Substrate-based Partner Chains, but it is possible to support other blockchains by implementing the `BlockchainApi` interface.
- **Pytest flavour**. You can write tests using well-known and one of the most popular frameworks, `pytest.`

### Partner Chains Tests - Infrastructure

![Test Infrastructure](/e2e-tests/docs/pc-tests-infra.png)

### Installation

1. Create and activate virtual environment

```bash
  pip install virtualenv
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Install sops to [manage keys](/e2e-tests/docs/secrets.md). You can also configure [your own keys with sops](/e2e-tests/docs/configure-sops.md)

### Getting Started

- Choose an environment to run tests. You have an option to run on [local](/e2e-tests/docs/run-tests-on-local-env.md) or [your own custom](/e2e-tests/docs/run-tests-on-new-env.md) environments
- Run `pytest -h` to see all available options, or simply `pytest` to execute all tests.

### Execution Options

```bash
Custom options:
  --ctrf=CTRF           generate test report. Report file name is optional
  --env=ENV             Target node environment
  --blockchain={substrate,midnight}
                        Blockchain network type
  --ci-run              Overrides config values specific for executing from ci runner
  --decrypt             Decrypts secrets and keys files
  --node-host=NODE_HOST
                        Overrides node host
  --node-port=NODE_PORT
                        Overrides node port
  --init-timestamp=INIT_TIMESTAMP
                        Initial timestamp of the mainchain.
  --latest-mc-epoch     Parametrize committee tests to verify whole last MC epoch. Transforms sc_epoch param to range of SC epochs for last MC epoch.
  --mc-epoch=MC_EPOCH   MC epoch that parametrizes committee tests to verify the whole given MC epoch. Translates sc_epoch param to range of SC epochs for given MC epoch.
  --sc-epoch=SC_EPOCH   SC epoch that parametrizes committee tests, default: <last_sc_epoch>.
```

### Examples

#### Run tests on the local environment

```bash
pytest -rP -v --blockchain substrate --env local --log-cli-level debug -vv -s -m "not probability"
```

#### Run multisig governance tests

To test the multisig governance functionality, you need to configure additional governance authorities in your configuration file. The tests will verify both single signature and multisig workflows.

```bash
pytest -rP -v --blockchain substrate --env local -m "multisig_governance"
```

The multisig tests verify:
1. Updating governance to use multiple authorities with a threshold of required signatures
2. Testing multisig operations for various governance actions (D parameter, permissioned candidates, reserve operations)
3. Creating, signing, and submitting transactions with multiple signatures
4. Restoring governance back to the original single key setup after tests complete

This test workflow ensures that the environment is left in the same state it started with, so that other tests that expect single-key governance will continue to work correctly.

### Configuration

For multisig testing, add the following to your configuration file:

```yaml
nodes_config:
  governance_authority:
    mainchain_address: "main_authority_address"
    mainchain_key: "path/to/main_authority.skey"
  additional_governance_authorities:
    - "path/to/second_authority.skey"
    - "path/to/third_authority.skey"
```

The `additional_governance_authorities` should be a list of paths to the signing key files for additional authorities.

## Continuous Integration Testing Layers

The Partner Chains CI pipeline validates each commit across four progressive testing layers, from fast local checks to long-running staging validations. Below is a breakdown of environments, coverage, and behavior across each stage.

| **Layer** | **Description** | **Validators** | **Environment** | **Test Coverage** | **Tests Run** | **Duration** | **Purpose & Details** |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|------------------|--------------------|----------------|--------------|------------------------|
| **CI Pre-Merge** | Runs on every pull request using `/dev/local-environment/`. | 5 (3 permissioned, 2 trustless) | Docker Compose | Smoke tests, RPC, metadata, committee epoch 2 | ~45 | ~7 min | Waits for epoch 2<br>Fails on skipped tests<br>Asserts node readiness and logs<br>Uses `setup.sh --non-interactive` to build full stack |
| **CI Post-Merge** | Full run post-merge on `/dev/local-environment/`. | 5 | Docker Compose | Full test suite across epochs 2, 3, 4 (except probability) | ~120 | ~10 min | Epoch-gated execution<br>Runs `--mc-epoch 3` full committee tests<br>Repeats test suite 3 times<br>Includes smart contract and native token test groups |
| **CI Preview (K8s)** | Cloud-native ephemeral test using ArgoCD-deployed `ci-preview`. | 7 (mixed) | Kubernetes | Smoke, RPC, metadata, committee sampling | ~30â€“40 | ~9 min | Uses `kubectl exec` to run tests inside validator pod<br>Runs `run-e2e-tests` with decrypt enabled<br>No ingress or external exposure required<br>Validates artifact compatibility with Kubernetes runtime |
| **Pre-Release (Staging)** | 2-day full soak test triggered manually via `release.yml`. | 7 | Kubernetes | All test groups: smart contracts, metadata, committee rotation, probabilities, native token | ~150+ | ~32 hrs | Deployed via ArgoCD into `staging-preview` namespace<br>Waits for finalized blocks before test execution<br>Validates across 3 mainchain epochs<br>Uses `--latest-mc-epoch` for full-cycle test coverage<br>Fails on skipped tests or misconfiguration |

## Continuous Integration Testing Environments

- **/dev/local-environment/**:
  - Built with `setup.sh`, which generates `.env` and `docker-compose.yml`
  - Composed of: 1 Cardano node, 1 Ogmios, 1 DB-Sync, 1 Postgres, 5 Partner Chain validator nodes
  - Setup container inserts DParam values and performs initial on-chain registration
  - Network bootstraps automatically on startup and begins block production after 2 epochs

- **ci-preview (Kubernetes)**:
  - Deployed via GitHub Actions and ArgoCD
  - Executes tests using `kubectl exec` directly into the validator container
  - Runs `run-e2e-tests` with `--decrypt` enabled
  - Artifacts are built and injected using Earthly and ECR

- **staging-preview (Kubernetes)**:
  - Used for pre-release final validation
  - 7 validator nodes run across multiple mainchain epochs
  - Blocks must be finalized before test suite execution begins
  - Includes native token tests, committee dynamics, registration, rewards, and governance
  - Results uploaded before GHCR or release publish workflows can proceed

All test layers upload full logs, metrics, and test reports to GitHub Artifacts for inspection and debugging.

### Test Execution

Tests are executed in CI using the `run-e2e-tests` action, which runs the following test categories:

```yaml
test_categories:
  - smoke
  - committee
  - delegator_rewards
  - smart_contracts
  - rpc
```

Each category is run with appropriate test markers and configurations to ensure comprehensive coverage of the Partner Chain functionality.
