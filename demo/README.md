# Partner Chains demo implementation

This directory contains a reference implementation of a complete Partner Chains node.
It consists of a runtime crate showcasing use of all Partner Chains SDK pallets and
a node implementation demonstrating how all node components, data sources and RPCs provided
by the Partner Chains SDK could be composed into a Substrate node.

This reference implementation is provided on a **best-effort basis**. Partner Chain builders
should always verify that examples contained in this directory are relevant to their
use case and architecture.

This reference implementation is **not** a template. Partner Chain builders looking
for a starting point for their code should use the
[official Polkadot SDK solochain template](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk-solochain-template).
