# Native Token Management Pallet

## About

This pallet exposes logic for a Partner Chain runtime to handle transfers of native token observed on the
main chain. See rustdoc comments for more information.

## Migration

See the guide in `docs/developer-guides/native-token-migration-guide.md` for how to add this
feature to an already running chain.
