# BEEFY Consensus Upgrade Testing Report

## Test Objective
Testing the upgrade process from master branch (non-BEEFY) to BEEFY-enabled consensus on Partner Chains network.

## Initial Network State Assessment

### Node Versions (Pre-upgrade)
- **Node 1**: `1.7.0-5f2afb1b15a` (BEEFY-enabled from `upgrade_with_beefy_testing` branch)
- **Nodes 2-6**: `1.7.0-de400f4b0cf` (Master branch, pre-BEEFY)

### Network Health Analysis
**Block Production**: All nodes actively producing and importing blocks
- Current block height: #614 (at 13:09 UTC)
- Network connectivity: 5 peers per node
- Block finality: Working (GRANDPA finalizing blocks ~2-3 blocks behind tip)

### Detailed Node Behavior Analysis

#### Node 1 (BEEFY-Enabled)
**Status**: ✅ BEEFY gadget active and operational
**Key Observations**:
- BEEFY gadget successfully started: `🥩 Transforming grandpa notification`
- Processing GRANDPA notifications into BEEFY format
- Gossip rebroadcast active: `🥩 Gossip rebroadcast`
- Block production: Both "ProBono" and "Incentivized" blocks
- No errors or warnings related to BEEFY functionality

**Sample BEEFY Log**:
```
2025-08-26 13:08:31.097 DEBUG beefy: 🥩 Transforming grandpa notification. #606(0x401a3e1ab18f8d01b4ea76acb1094089ad5cb9ddb3fcfb9526309c713ba661b2)
2025-08-26 13:08:46.057 TRACE beefy: 🥩 Gossip rebroadcast
```

#### Node 2 (Master Branch)
**Status**: ✅ Normal operation on master
**Key Observations**:
- Normal block production and import
- Block authoring: `🙌 Starting consensus session` → `🎁 Prepared block` → `🔖 Pre-sealed block`
- ProBono block production active
- No BEEFY-related logs (as expected)

#### Node 3 (Master Branch)  
**Status**: ✅ Normal import-only operation
**Key Observations**:
- Importing blocks from network
- GRANDPA authority set changes processing normally
- Not actively authoring blocks in observed period
- Network connectivity healthy (5 peers)

#### Node 4 (Master Branch)
**Status**: ✅ Active block production  
**Key Observations**:
- Active block authoring: ProBono blocks
- Consensus session management working
- Block preparation and sealing normal
- Authority set changes processed correctly

#### Node 5 (Master Branch)
**Status**: ✅ Active block production
**Key Observations**:
- Incentivized block production active
- Block hash transformations normal (pre-sealed vs final)
- Network synchronization healthy
- Both ProBono and Incentivized blocks produced

#### Node 6 (Master Branch) 
**Status**: ✅ Normal operation
**Key Observations**:
- Committee rotation and session management active
- Block participation data processing: `🧾 Processing block participation data`
- ProBono block production
- No indication of issues with master branch operation

### Key Findings

1. **BEEFY Integration Success**: Node 1 successfully integrated BEEFY consensus without breaking compatibility with master branch nodes
2. **Network Compatibility**: Mixed network (1 BEEFY + 5 master) operates normally - no consensus issues
3. **BEEFY Key Pre-configuration**: BEEFY keys appear to be pre-configured in the Docker setup (no manual key generation required)
4. **Block Production Distribution**: All node types (BEEFY-enabled and master) can produce blocks in current configuration

### Important Notes for Documentation

#### BEEFY Keys Auto-Configuration
**Finding**: BEEFY keys appear to be automatically available from Docker configuration
**Impact**: We did not test manual BEEFY key generation process 
**Recommendation**: Separate testing needed for:
- `partner-chains-node wizard generate-keys --beefy` command
- `author_rotateKeys` RPC endpoint for BEEFY key generation
- Manual keystore management for BEEFY keys

#### Network Behavior Before Runtime Upgrade
**Current State**: BEEFY-enabled nodes can coexist with master branch nodes without runtime upgrade
**Block Production**: Both node types actively participate in block production
**Consensus**: Network operates on standard Aura/GRANDPA consensus with BEEFY gadget running in parallel

## Node Upgrade Process

### Upgrade Strategy
Sequential upgrade of nodes 2-5 to BEEFY-enabled binaries, leaving node 6 on master branch for post-upgrade testing.

### Node 2 Upgrade Process
**Timestamp**: 2025-08-26 13:10 UTC
**Pre-upgrade State**: 
- Version: 1.7.0-de400f4b0cf

- **BEEFY Status**: `🥩 BEEFY gadget waiting for BEEFY pallet to become available...`
- **Network Impact**: No disruption, continued block production

### Node 3 Upgrade Process  
**Timestamp**: 2025-08-26 13:18 UTC
**Pre-upgrade State**:
- Version: 1.7.0-de400f4b0cf
- Block height: #695  
- Status: Healthy, producing ProBono blocks

**Node 3 Upgrade Complete** ✅
- **Time**: 13:19 UTC
- **Result**: Success - Binary upgraded, BEEFY gadget initialized  
- **Version**: `1.7.0-de400f4b0cf` → `1.7.0-5f2afb1b15a`
- **BEEFY Status**: `🥩 BEEFY gadget waiting for BEEFY pallet to become available...`
- **Network Impact**: No disruption, active block production and authoring

### Current Network State (3/6 nodes upgraded)

└──────┴─────────────────────┴──────────┴───────┴────────────────────┘
```

### Critical Observation: BEEFY Activity
**Only Node 1 shows active BEEFY processing** (`🥩 Transforming grandpa notification`)
**Nodes 2-3 show BEEFY waiting state** (`🥩 BEEFY gadget waiting for BEEFY pallet to become available...`)

**Analysis**: This suggests that:
1. BEEFY gadget initializes successfully on all upgraded nodes
2. Active BEEFY processing requires runtime upgrade to enable BEEFY pallet
3. Node 1 may have different configuration or was running during a different state
