### :information_source: About

The Partner Chains Toolkit provides a collection features and cli commands enabling users to
either **build new partner chains** (_=chain builder_), or **operate validators** provided
by the chain builder (_=validator_).

Relevant features include:

* **Minotaur**: A multi-resource selection algorithm combining validators from multiple networks
into a single joint-consensus mechanism. Version 1 is exclusive to Cardano.
* **D-Param**: Secure bootstrapping of a partner chain through a configurable ratio of public (registered)
versus permissioned validators.
* **Multi-sig Governance**: Decentralized and secure governance of a partner chain through
a set of Governance Authorities with a configurable threshold.
* **Native Token Reserve Management**: Initialization and maintenance of a secure token reserve on Cardano
that is observed on a partner chain.
* **Block Production Rewards**: Enabling the creation and maintenance of a reward system for block
producers and delegators.

### :warning: Prerequisites
While the toolkit is built with convenience and ease-of-use in mind, using it to build new partner chains requires
experience in several domains:
- Strong blockchain background in general
- Cardano ecosystem and tools
- Polkadot ecosystem and tools
- Rust programming language

### :hammer_and_wrench: How to Build
The project provides a [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix) environment that provides all necessary tools
and dependencies for building it (You can also choose to install dependencies manually but we won't
officially support or document this approach).
```bash
$ nix develop # enter the development shell
$ cargo build
```
**Note**: The first invocation of `nix develop` may take some time since it fetches all required
dependencies.

### :white_check_mark: How to Test
Please refer to our [Testing](./e2e-tests/README.md) documentation on how to run our end-to-end
tests. The unit tests can be invoked as expected using cargo:
```bash
$ cargo test
```
_Note_: _The tests make use of [testcontainers](https://rust.testcontainers.org/) so you will need
to have a working docker setup to execute the tests_.

### :books: Documentation
Please refer to our [Introduction](./docs/intro.md) to learn in more detail about what the Partner
Chain Toolkit offers and how to use it for different use-cases.
