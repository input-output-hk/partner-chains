## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any issues you may find.

To report a vulnerability, please use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature. This allows you to communicate directly with our security team without publicly disclosing the vulnerability details.

**Steps to report a vulnerability:**

1. Navigate to the [Security tab](https://github.com/input-output-hk/partner-chains/security) of our GitHub repository.
2. Click on "Report a vulnerability" to start the private reporting process.
3. Provide as much detail as possible about the vulnerability and any potential impacts.

**What to expect:**

-   We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
-   Our team will review the issue and work with you to understand its impact.
-   You will receive updates on the status of your report at least once every five business days.
-   If the vulnerability is accepted, we will coordinate with you on an appropriate disclosure timeline.

Thank you for helping us keep our project secure!
